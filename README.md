# Cards Against Humanity

Cards Against Humanity is a fill-in-the-blank party game that turns your awkward personality and lackluster social skills into hours of fun! Wow.
The game is simple. Each round, one player asks a question from a black card, and everyone else answers with their funniest white card.
